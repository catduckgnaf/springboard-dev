# GitHub Codespaces & Dev Container ♥️ Springboard

Welcome to your shiny new Codespace and dev container for Springboard!

I created this, with the correct dependancies, versions, and requirements. Because I was switching between 5+ different machines during coursework. In addition to other projects. 

Code from anywhere, install all the useful vs code extensions and settings  

Use in browser for when all you kids who thought you were cool using a mac lose access to vs code

but in the mean time, you can also open in vs code. more instructions unlikely to come.

I plan to add starter code for various languages, tips and hints  

# Getting Started:

I mean really if you don't know how to do these next steps, you should probably just quit and work and wendys.

See that green button at the top right of this text that says code? Yea click that
Now click on codespaces
You will see current branch springboard-dev (unless I renamed the branch and didn't update the readme)
To the right click on the three dots, then "open in"
You can choose to open in browser, which is really cool! 
Or you can open in VS Code. Where it will set up everything for you!! You will have a complete development envirement.
You will have all the awesome extensions, correct versions of everything, some starter code, and very likely unhelpful sarcasm buried somewhere.


# Features:

## HTML  CSS  Javascript 

Here we have some basic templates for getting started with what I like to call the unholy trinity. (can you tell I don't like front end?)

## Python

Every cool kids favorite langauge.
Don't drive yourself crazy with venv and differnet machines and setting up envirements just for a 1 hour code exercise. 
Yes learning this is important, but you shouldn't need to spend 8 hours setting up a dev envirement for 2 hour code project
Some fun extensions such as running doctests right inside VS code.

## Flask

I mean, its better then CSS and templates and Jinja are cool right? 
Even though Flask is on 3.0, springboard still uses 1.x.x. 
We keepin' it old skool here.

## Postgres 

I haven't added anything here but I will, maybe, someday, PR anyone?

## Node

Hey, this is way better then outdated Jquery, thank you springboard!

## Git

yea, you get that extension too

# Do I take donations?

Absolutely, I am jewish. and who doesn't love a coupon? So if you found this page and you HAVEN'T yet signed up for springboard, if you use my referall link you will get a discount.
So basically it is like I am paying you! Better someone giving back to the community then some rando on reddit, (thats who got my referall code)
100% of all money recieved will go to making sure I can pay github to host codespaces, and if there is extra I will donate it to some open source project that is worthy.
