# GitHub Codespaces & Dev Container ♥️ Springboard

Welcome to your shiny new Codespace and dev container for Springboard!

I created this, with the correct dependancies, versions, and requirements. Because I was switching between 5+ different machines during coursework. In addition to other projects. 

Code from anywhere, install all the useful vs code extensions and settings. Codespace is a work in progress!

In the mean time, you can also open in vs code, follow the prompts and you are good to go! more instructions unlikely to come.
Note, the first time it may take a while to open inside the container.

# Getting Started:

I mean really if you don't know how to do these next steps, you should probably just quit and work and wendys.

See that green button at the top right of this text that says code? Yea click that
Now click on codespaces
You will see current branch springboard-dev (unless I renamed the branch and didn't update the readme)
To the right click on the three dots, then "open in"
You can choose to open in browser, which is really cool! 
Or you can open in VS Code. Where it will set up everything for you!! You will have a complete development envirement.
You will have all the awesome extensions, correct versions of everything, some starter code, and very likely unhelpful sarcasm buried somewhere.


# Features:

## General VS Code Extensions and settings

Have basic (and some non basic extensions) Such as "Live Server".
We also have a .EditorConfig to make sure that UTF-8 is unabled, and End of Line is LF everywhere it supposed to be.

Also, we have bash intergrated shell easily from VS Code. 

## HTML  CSS  Javascript 

I plan to add some basic things there, but essentially its mostly just live server at the moment, and some minor settings to make your life easier.

## Python

python 3.7.17 by default!
ipython 7.34.0 by default 


## Flask


blinker==1.4
Click==7.0
Flask==1.0.2
Flask-DebugToolbar==0.10.1
itsdangerous==1.1.0
Jinja2==2.10
MarkupSafe==1.1.0
Werkzeug==0.14.1


## Database / SQL / Postgres 

I am looking into building Postgres and SQL into one development container. I am looking to see if there is an easy way to do that without interfering with the current set up. 
This is next on the list.

## Node JS

Hey, this is way better then outdated Jquery, thank you springboard! (beyond the sarcastic comment its a work in progress)

## React 

I have not gotten around to this yet, but if anyone wants to submit an issue, or a PR I will make it inclusive.

## further todo:

1. I plan to add more starter code for various language
   
2. Prebuilt containers (so you don't need to wait as long to get set up)

4. Fully working codespaces!
   
5. Better documentation, maybe some testing. unless I get distract......OOOH A SQUIRREL 

# How can I help your awesome project?

In addition to the notice below, please submit issues, or PRs with suggestions and things that are not working. Especially if Springboard updates coursework, or things are not working as expected.
you can make an issue, or submit a PR.

# Do I take donations?

o if you found this page and you HAVEN'T yet signed up for springboard, if you use my referall link you will get a discount.
So basically it is like I am paying you! Better someone giving back to the community then some rando on reddit, (thats who got my referall code)
100% of all money recieved will go to making sure I can pay github to host codespaces, and if there is extra I will donate it to some open source project that is worthy.
